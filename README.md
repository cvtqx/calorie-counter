## Why I created this project
These days I am into growing muscle. (And if you saw me you would never believe that). Exercise alone does not help if you are not eating enough, so I created this simple calorie calculating tool which will help me to understand how much (more) I need to eat. 

I am using this project for practice and will be adding features as they come along.

## API

The project uses Edamam Nutrition Analysis API.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
